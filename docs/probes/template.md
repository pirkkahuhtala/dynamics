# Probe Template

**Status:** Planned | Running | Completed (Success) | Completed (Failure) | Completed (Inconclusive) | Cancelled
**Date created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Cynefin domain:** Complex
**Related area:** [Area on Cynefin map]
**Related probes:** [Links to related probes, if any]

## Hypothesis

[What we believe to be true. State it as a testable claim.]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Observable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Observable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Observable outcome 3]

## Failure Criteria

- [ ] [What would disprove the hypothesis]
- [ ] [What would indicate we should stop]

## Dampening Strategy

[How to stop or reverse this experiment if it goes wrong or is taking too long.
What is the maximum acceptable cost/impact of this probe?]

## Timeline

- **Start:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Evaluate by:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Maximum duration:** [Duration]

## Effort

[Estimated effort — keep it small. Express in hours or days, not weeks.]

## Approach

### Observations
- [What happened — factual observations]

### Data
[Any quantitative data collected]

### Learnings
- [What we learned — insights and implications]

### Recommendation
- [ ] More probes needed (stay in Complex)
- [ ] Pattern emerging — consider `/validate` (Alpha inflection)
- [ ] Hypothesis disproved — new direction needed
- [ ] Consider `/mob` for fresh perspectives
- [ ] Consider `/pivot` for radical rethink
