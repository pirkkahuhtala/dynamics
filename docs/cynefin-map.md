# Cynefin Map

> This is the single source of truth for where each project area sits in the Cynefin framework.
> Updated by `/assess`, `/validate`, `/retro`, and `/pivot` commands.

## Current Map

| # | Area | Domain | Confidence | Last Assessed | Inflection Point | Next Step |

## Domain Summary

### Complex (Probe-Sense-Respond)
_Areas where cause-and-effect is only visible in retrospect. We experiment._

> No areas currently in Complex domain.

### Complicated (Sense-Analyze-Respond)
_Areas where cause-and-effect is analyzable by experts. We build with expertise._

> No areas currently in Complicated domain.

### Clear (Sense-Categorize-Respond)
_Areas where cause-and-effect is obvious. We standardize and automate._

> No areas currently in Clear domain.

### Chaotic / Aporetic
_Areas with no visible cause-and-effect, or needing radical rethinking._

> No areas currently in Chaotic/Aporetic domain.
